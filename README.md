# clips-md-docs

This is an attempt to convert the [CLIPS](https://clipsrules.net/) documentation to Markdown format.
The current documentation is written in Word files and exported as PDF files.

An initial goal of this repository is to provide the CLIPS documentation in a more open/extensible format.
A further goal is to serve the documentation using a framework, bringing search/pagination/linking features which are difficult to get from PDF files.
